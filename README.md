### Hi there 👋

My name is Théo Gianella. I'm a former PhD candidate in French literature and upcoming developer, having completed a 6 months bootcamp in web development at The Hacking Project. I just started my first job as a junior JS developer at [Zenika](https://www.zenika.com/) in Lyon !

Lastly I released my (humble) first npm package: a small CLI program to easily and smoothly create new React components. You can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tgianella/create-react-component-cli) ! :tada:

Currently I am working on honing my JS and react skills, hit me up with any tips or advice you might have ! 📖
